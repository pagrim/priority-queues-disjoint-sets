# Priority Queues and Disjoint Sets

These are my solutions to week 2 of the [Coursera Data Structures course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/), which is part of the [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms).

This includes solutions to these problems:
* _Merge Tables_ - combine rows of a table using disjoint sets
* _Parallel Processor_ - process threads using a min heap
